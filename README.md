# Explanatory and Exploratory Data Analysis

Implemented Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analyses to provide foundational insights
which are crucial for feature identification and manipulation in Feature Engineering and subsequently
inform the selection and preparation of features for Ensemble Methods.

## Explanatory Data Analysis

involves:

- **Univariate Analysis**: Examining the distribution of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships between two variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigating interactions between multiple variables.

### Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis involves examining the distribution and characteristics of individual variables. Techniques used include:

**Histograms**: Used to visualize the distribution of a single variable.

**Box Plots**: Used to display the distribution of a variable and identify outliers.

**Descriptive Statistics**: Calculations such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance to summarize the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

### Bivariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables. Techniques used include:

**Scatter Plots**: Used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.

**Correlation Coefficients**: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

**Heatmaps**: Used to visualize the correlation matrix, showing the correlation coefficients between multiple pairs of variables.

**Box Plots**: Used to compare the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories of a categorical variable.

### Multivariate Analysis

Multivariate analysis involves examining the interactions between multiple variables. Techniques used include:

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a set of orthogonal components, capturing the maximum variance in the data.

**Parallel Coordinates Plot**: Used to visualize high-dimensional data by plotting each variable on a separate axis and connecting the data points with lines.

**Pair Plots**: Used to visualize pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset.

**Libraries and Functions Used:**
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
**NumPy**: For numerical operations.
**Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
**Seaborn**: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
**Plotly Express**: For creating interactive visualizations.
**Scikit-learn**: For machine learning techniques such as PCA and data preprocessing (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis focuses on discovering patterns, spotting anomalies, and testing hypotheses. Techniques used include:

### Uses the Same techniques as the Explanatory DA

Used another dataset, `YourData.csv`, to perform the exploratory analysis.
